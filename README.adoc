# sicp

Meant to contain the sicp exercises that I practice in Clojure.

Not meant to contain all the examples, only those that I find not apparent.

The will be individual folder for each chapter under link:src/sicp/[here], which contains files for individual problems.d


## Structure:

- Each chapter problems will be under namespace `sicp.ch<chapter_number>`.
- And practice of sections will be under file `c<chapter_number>s<section_number>.clj`
- Programs of exercise problem will be under file `c<chapter_number>e<section_number>.clj`
